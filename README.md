It's the classic matching card game! Tap a card to reveal an emoji. Tap a second card to find a matching emoji.
If you fail to get a match, the cards will flip back over. Play until you win (or quit if you're a sore loser). Options are included in initial view controller
to play a 2x2, 4x4, or a 6x6 game. When the game is won, reset to play again, or pop back to the options controller.
